# About me

I am currently in my last year of study at the EPSI school of computer engineering. I am passionante about data.
I particularly like to make sense of them and see them impacting reality.

# My Recents personal projects

## [Heart disease UCI analysis](https://github.com/anthony-coplo/Heart-disease-UCI-analysis)
 ![](images/493ss_thinkstock_rf_heart_anatomy_illustration.webp)
 
 Perform analysis on the open dataset Heart disease UCI on Kaggle.
 This dataset contains 76 attributes, but all published experiments refer to using a subset of 14 of them. In particular, the Cleveland database is the only one that has been used by ML researchers to this date. The "goal" field refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient. It is integer valued from 0 (no presence) to 4.



## [Calculate the length of stay in hospital using Regression](https://github.com/anthony-coplo/LOS-in-hospital)

Dataset :  [Link](https://microsoft.github.io/r-server-hospital-length-of-stay/input_data.html)
The goal of this project is to provide a predicted length of stay (LOS) for each patient at the time of their admission to the hospital. The inputs will include characteristics such as patient diagnoses (heart disease, blood tests, etc.), sex, etc.

Repo contain : 
- HTML / CSS
- Jupyter notebook used for aanalysis and model creation
- The final flask app file

In order to use the app in local environment [you need to download the pre trained model](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xaQQ1QC-o2w8Z7YNCz1l7cOqbe6mUGNn/view?usp=sharing).

The project has been deployed on heroku, so you can go to :
