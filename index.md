# About me

I am currently in my last year of study at the EPSI school of computer engineering. I am passionante about data.
I particularly like to make sense of them and see them impacting reality.

# My Recents personal projects

## [Calculate the length of stay in hospital using Regression](https://github.com/anthony-coplo/LOS-in-hospital)
Dataset :  [Link](https://microsoft.github.io/r-server-hospital-length-of-stay/input_data.html)
The goal of this project is to provide a predicted length of stay (LOS) for each patient at the time of their admission to the hospital. The inputs will include characteristics such as patient diagnoses (heart disease, blood tests, etc.), sex, etc.
